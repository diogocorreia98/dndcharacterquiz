# dndcharacterquiz

Simple web app for choosing a D&D character species, class and background. Includes PTâ€‘PT and EN translations.

* Both the English and Portuguese species quizzes now begin with a question about character height, leading through identical decision trees in each language.
* Questions in the class and background sections are shown one at a time, letting you advance through the quiz page by page.
* The results page displays Portuguese names for species, classes and backgrounds when that language is selected.
